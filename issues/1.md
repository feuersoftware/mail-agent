# Issue: Release Workflow Failure

## Description
The release workflow has encountered a failure due to a PowerShell syntax error:

```
Unexpected token } in expression or statement.
```

This error is caused by a misplaced or unmatched curly brace in the script that handles critical and high severity vulnerabilities.

## Suggested Action
Please review the block for `$criticalFindings` and `$highFindings` to ensure that all curly braces are correctly matched and placed. Here's a suggested correction:

```powershell
# Example correction
if ($criticalFindings.Count -gt 0) {
    # Handle critical findings
}

if ($highFindings.Count -gt 0) {
    # Handle high findings
}
```

This should resolve the syntax error and allow the workflow to proceed successfully.
